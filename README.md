#### Functions
   The arguments of a function and any variable in the function body that does not
   exist in the global scope are considered to be in the local scope.

## Testing

This java project uses Maven. Please have maven installed to perform testing.
For testing, the main program takes test file path as a command line argument.
The test folder contains several test files testing individual funtionality.

###  To run a test

```
   mvn clean install
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="testfile.bc"
```
